In order of being invoked

constructor (props)
  - a special function that will get called whenever a new component is created
  - Used for initializing state and binding event handler
  - Do not cause side effects eg: HTTP request
  - Call super(props)
  - It is the only place where you are expected to directly overwrite this.state otherwise use setState()

static getDerivedStateProps(props,state)
  - React says it is rarely used
  - used when the state of component depends on changes in props over time.
  - it doesn't has access to this keyword as it is static
  - do not cause side effects

render()
  - only required method in class component
  - returns JSX
  - do not change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls
  - it may contain other child component so lifecycle methods of child components are called right after parent's render()

componentDidMount()
  - called only once in whole lifecycle
  - invoked immediately after a component and all its children components have been rendered to the DOM.
  - you may interact with DOM or perform ajax calls
