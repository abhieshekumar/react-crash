A component goes through several stages in it's lifecycle.

React provides built in methods that we can override at particular  stages in the life cycle.

LIFECYCLE METHODS for CLASS COMPONENETS

Phases of Methods : 
  |- Mounting - when an instance is being created and inserted into dom
  |- Updating - when a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state
  |- Unmounting - when a component is being removed from the DOM
  |- Error Handling - when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor ofany child component

Mounting Phases - constructor(), static getDerivedStateFromProps(), render() and componentDidMount()

Updating Phase - static getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate()

Unmounting Phase - componentWillUnmount()

Error Handling - static getDerivedStateFromError() and componentDidCatch()
