A class component that implements either one or both of the lifecycle methods getDerivedStateFromError() or componentDidCatch() becomes an error boundary

The static method getDerivedStateFromError method is used to render a fallback UI after an error is thrown and the componentDidCatch method is used to log the error information.

Everything inside ErrorBoundary in catched and fallback UI is displayed. We may wrap each component with error boundary
