Nesting in components

Requirement : Component A,D and F are to display the username which is stored in AppComp

For A - simple passdown to A
For B - pass prop to B and then to D
For F - pass prop to C and E and finally to F

Here prop isn't needed by B, C and E but yet passed down ? 

Context provides a way to pass data throught the component tree without having to pass down props manually a every level
